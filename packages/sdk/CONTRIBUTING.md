# Contributing to sdk-react

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! This guide will help you get started with the development process.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Bun installed on your system

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repo-name`
4. Install dependencies: `bun install`
5. Start development: `bun run dev`

### ðŸš€ Full Development Mode (Recommended)

For the best development experience with instant feedback:

1. **Terminal 1**: Run `bun run dev` - This watches your source files and rebuilds the library instantly on any change
2. **Terminal 2**: Run `bun run dev:test` - This starts a Next.js preview app at http://localhost:3000

This setup provides **instant rebuild and instant reflection** in the preview app. When you save any component file, you'll see the changes immediately in your browser without any waiting. It's a beautiful development experience! âœ¨

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Start the full development mode (see above) for instant feedback
3. Make your changes and test them live in the preview app
4. Fix linting and formatting: `bun run lint:fix`
5. Build the project: `bun run build`
6. Commit your changes using the conventions below
7. Push your branch to your fork
8. Open a pull request
